# First_Swing_Application
My First Swing application using the Swing framework to create a simple Deposit/Withdraw banking application.

My intention behind this project was to familarise myself with using the Swing framework, to help me learn about GUI's.
The project has also helped me to put into practice some of the things I have been learning in my own time from sites such as Hackerrank and codewars, 
for example having previously used the NumberFormat library this was incredibly useful for being able to show values that more closely resemble an actual
banking application.
